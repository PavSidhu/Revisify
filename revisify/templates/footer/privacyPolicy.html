		</p>

			law, develop our service or to protect your rights.

  <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
  <p class="alignLeft">
		Like most website operators, Revisify collects
		non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
		servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
		preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
		This information is shared with Google Inc. (Analytics) to store Revisify's
		user's Anonymous usage data. Revisify's purpose in collecting non-personally
		identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our
		website. From time to time, Revisify may release non-personally-identifying
		information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
		usage of its website.
	<p>
  <p class="alignLeft">
		Revisify also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
		Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Revisify does not use
		such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose
		such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and
		discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

  <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
  <p class="alignLeft">
		Certain visitors to Revisify choose to interact with our services in ways
		that require Revisify to gather personally-identifying information. The
		amount and type of information that Revisify gathers depends on the nature
		of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account
		at Revisify to provide their name and email address. Those who engage in
		transactions with Brainflare are asked to provide additional information,
		including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
		process those transactions. In each case, Revisify collects such information
		only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
		visitor's interaction with Revisify. Revisify does not disclose
		personally-identifying information other than as described below. And
		visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,
		with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
		website-related activities.

  <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
  <p class="alignLeft">
		Revisify may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
		websites. For instance, Revisify may monitor the users time spent on the
		website. Revisify may display this information publicly or provide it to
		others. However, Revisify does not disclose personally-identifying
		information other than as described below.
	</p>

<section class="narrowWidth">
  <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
  <p class="alignLeft">
		Revisify discloses potentially personally-identifying and
		personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
		contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
		information in order to process it on Revisify's behalf or to provide
		services available at Revisify's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to
		disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
		organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
		Revisify's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
		them. Automattic will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying
		and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
		employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above,
		Revisify discloses potentially personally-identifying and
		personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
		order or other governmental request, or when Revisify believes in good faith
		that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
		Revisify, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user
		of Revisify and have supplied your email address, Revisify may occasionally
		send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or
		just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Revisify and our service.
		If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
		feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
		clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
		Revisify takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
		unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
		personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

		Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Revisify's sole discretion.
		Revisify encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes
		to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in
