	<h1>Revisify is Closing Down</h1>

	<p class="alignLeft">After a lot of thought I've decided that the time for Revisify has come to an end.</p>
	<p class="alignLeft">Revisify was an attempt to take some of the pain out of memorization but it didn't solve the root of the problem. Even if Revisify became a large success, would it be right to be profiting from a problem that I want to see a change in?</p>

	<p class="alignLeft">If you still want to keep your topics send me an email to <a href="mailto:support@revisify.com?subject=Save My Topics!" style="color: white">support@revisify.com</a> and Iâ€™ll send you a copy of your topics that you can import into <a href="https://quizlet.com" style="color: white">Quizlet</a>.</p>

	<p class="alignLeft"> <span style="color: #BFCA33">Revisify will continue to run until October 1st</span> so that everyone has plenty of time to export their data. You will no longer be able to access your account, your subjects, your followers and your results after October 1st.</p>

	<p class="alignLeft">Thank you to everyone for your suggestions and your support over the past 2 years, itâ€™s been a lot of fun.</p>

	<p class="alignLeft">Onto the next project, <br>Pav ðŸ˜„</p>
